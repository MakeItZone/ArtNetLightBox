# ArtNetLightBox

This project is to create an ESP8266/ESP32 based ArtNET/DMX interface to the LED light cubes that were donated to MakeItZone.

The code is in two main branches:

- a sender experiment: for sending ArtNET/DMX data from the ESP to a PC (eg QLC+)
- a receiver experiment: for receiving and displaying ArtNET/DMX channels as light
